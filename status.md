## Remediation Plans

### REM-001 — Drop Go Plugin Scanner Path
- **Affects:** `registry-scanner`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — all tasks complete.
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] Remove `.so` loading code from `registry-scanner` (never added — external process only)
  - [x] Spawn plugins with `exec.CommandContext` (OS-level deadline)
  - [x] Validate plugin binary checksum (SHA256) against `SCANNER_PLUGIN_CHECKSUM` before loading
  - [x] Add `io.LimitedReader` on plugin stdout (max 10MB) — pipe+LimitReader pattern in process.go
  - [x] Define explicit env allowlist for plugin subprocess — `pluginEnv()` in process.go passes only PATH/HOME/TMPDIR/TRIVY_*/GRYPE_* prefixes
  - [x] Update `§4.7` in CLAUDE.md to remove Go plugin references (CLAUDE.md §4.7 describes external process only)

---

### REM-002 — JWT Revocation TTL Coupling
- **Affects:** `registry-auth`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — implemented in services/auth with `time.Until(claims.ExpiresAt.Time)` as Redis TTL.

---

### REM-003 — Proxy Background Store via RabbitMQ
- **Affects:** `registry-proxy`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — RabbitMQ retry path fully implemented.
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] Define `store.queued` event type in `libs/rabbitmq/events` (`StoreQueuedPayload`)
  - [x] On background goroutine failure: publish `store.queued` event via `publishStoreQueued()`
  - [x] Implement `store.queued` consumer in `registry-proxy` server.go (`HandleStoreQueued` + `retryStoreBlob`)
  - [x] On retry: re-fetch blob from upstream with original credentials
  - [x] Dead-letter after 3 retries (consumer.Config MaxRetries: 3)

---

### REM-004 — Custom Domain Verification Notifications
- **Affects:** `registry-tenant`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — notifications + backoff + DB columns all implemented.
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] Add `Notified24h`, `Notified48h` bool fields to `DomainRecord`; migration `20260611000001_domain_notification.sql`
  - [x] Send 24h notification (logged + `MarkDomain24hNotified`) when age ≥ 24h, idempotent via flag
  - [x] Send 48h failure notification when age ≥ 47h, idempotent via flag
  - [x] Exponential backoff: age <1h → 5min, 1h–12h → 10min, >12h → 20min (`calcBackoff`)
  - [x] `next_poll_after` column + index; `ListUnverifiedDomains` filters `next_poll_after <= now()`
  - [x] 8 unit tests in `worker_test.go` — all passing

---

### REM-005 — Audit Table RLS + Role Separation
- **Affects:** `registry-audit`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — migration `20240101000002_audit_rls_role.sql` + server.go AfterConnect + checkRole().
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] Create `registry_audit_app` NOLOGIN role in migration: INSERT + SELECT on audit_events, DELETE on audit_events_default (retention path only)
  - [x] Add `ALTER TABLE audit_events FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` to migration
  - [x] Add `INSERT` policy: `WITH CHECK (true)`
  - [x] Add `SELECT` policy: `USING (true)` (tenant isolation via app-layer WHERE clauses)
  - [x] Pool `AfterConnect` does `SET ROLE registry_audit_app` on every connection
  - [x] `checkRole()` startup check refuses to start if effective role ≠ `registry_audit_app`

---

### REM-006 — Connection Pool Exhaustion Handling
- **Affects:** `registry-auth`, `registry-audit`, `registry-metadata`, `registry-tenant`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — `libs/config/loader.DBConfig.PoolConfig()` sets `ConnectTimeout: 5s`, `MaxConnLifetime: 30m`, `MaxConnIdleTime: 5m` with safe defaults. All DB-owning services use `DBConfig` + `pgxpool.NewWithConfig`. `sslmode=disable` rejected at startup.

---

### REM-007 — Registry-Metadata Caching (Part A — Redis)
- **Affects:** `registry-metadata`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — server-side cache interceptor wired in metadata.
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] `CacheInterceptor` in `libs/middleware/grpc/cache.go` — server-side `UnaryServerInterceptor`
  - [x] Cache key format: `grpc:<full_method>:<tenant_id>:<primary_key>`; stored as proto.Marshal bytes
  - [x] TTLs: GetRepository→30s, GetManifest→5m, GetTag→30s, GetTenantQuotaUsage→10s
  - [x] Corrupted entries evicted automatically; cache failure is non-fatal (fallthrough to handler)
  - [x] Wired in `metadata/internal/server/buildGRPCOptions()`

---

### REM-008 — Registry-Metadata Read Replica (Part B)
- **Affects:** `registry-metadata`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — replica pool wired and list queries routed.
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] `DBConfig.ReplicaPoolConfig()` added to `libs/config/loader/loader.go`
  - [x] `repository.NewWithReplica(pool, readPool)` + `reader()` helper — falls back to primary when readPool is nil
  - [x] `ListRepositories`, `ListTags`, `ListOrphanedBlobs` route to `r.reader()`
  - [x] Replica pool created in server.go when `DB_DSN_REPLICA` is set; warns and continues without when unset

---

### REM-009 — GC Advisory Locks
- **Affects:** `registry-gc`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — advisory locking fully implemented.
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] `advisory.Locker` in `services/gc/internal/advisory/lock.go` — FNV-64a key from tenant UUID
  - [x] `pg_try_advisory_lock($1)` — non-blocking; tenant skipped when lock not acquired (`TenantsSkipped` counter in Result)
  - [x] Single pinned connection via `pgxpool.Acquire()`; explicit `pg_advisory_unlock` + `Release()` in deferred unlock func
  - [x] `GC_ADVISORY_LOCK_DB_DSN` env var; graceful no-op when unset (single-worker mode)

---

### REM-010 — Move Scanner Interface Location
- **Affects:** `libs/`, `services/scanner`
- **Status:** DONE ✅ — `libs/scanner/plugin/plugin.go` created during monorepo scaffold; `services/scanner` imports from there.

---

## Notes

- **Build order (reference):** `proto/` → `libs/` → `services/auth` → `services/metadata` → `services/storage` → `services/core` → (remaining services in parallel). All steps now DONE.
- **Go workspace:** `go.work` at repo root links all 14 modules (libs, proto/gen/go, 12 services). All go.mod files standardised to `go 1.25.7`. Last commit: `a9dc176`.
- **Module path:** `github.com/steveokay/oci-janus`
- **Full stack running (2026-06-10):** All 16 docker-compose containers (12 services + postgres, redis, rabbitmq, minio, jaeger, vault, cert-init) reach healthy/running state. Key fixes applied: `GOWORK=off` in all Dockerfiles, Viper env-seeding in all config loaders, `sslmode=prefer` for dev postgres, `embed.FS` for goose migrations, `PRIMARY KEY (id, occurred_at)` on partitioned audit table, static `/healthcheck` binary in distroless images, `chmod a+r` for cert volume permissions, OTLP endpoint without `http://` prefix.
- **OCI conformance 75/75 PASS (2026-06-12):** `make test-conformance` passes full OCI Distribution Spec v1.1 suite. Runs in CI on every PR to `main`.
- Vault dev mode in docker-compose is ready — `services/signer` can be tested locally now.
- `infra/terraform/` directory is present but empty — Terraform deferred per Decision #10.
- **Frontend (2026-06-12):** `ui/` renamed to `frontend/`. Login page shipped: TanStack Router, zod+react-hook-form, Hanken Grotesk font, frosted-glass card matching Stitch reference. Dev server: `cd frontend && npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173. Remaining screens: Dashboard, Image Details, Security Scan, Build History.
- Security audit completed 2026-06-10 — SEC-019 through SEC-028 added to `security.md`. Notable open items: HTTP server timeouts missing on 6 services (SEC-019/020), healthcheck binary lacks timeout (SEC-021), `sslmode=prefer` in dev compose (SEC-022), `context.Background()` in handlers (SEC-028).
- **CI security gaps closed (2026-06-10):** `govulncheck` added to all 12 service CI workflows; `ci-gitleaks.yml` added for secret scanning on all pushes/PRs. Commit `a919cd4`.
- **AUTH_REALM fix (2026-06-10):** `services/core` WWW-Authenticate realm was hardcoded to `https://registry/auth/token` (internal Compose hostname). Now reads from `AUTH_REALM` env var, defaulting to `http://localhost:8080/auth/token`. Docker push/pull from host now works. Commit `cb241bd`.
- **docker push/pull chain fixes (2026-06-10):** 6 root causes debugged and resolved to make `docker push localhost:8081/steveokay/alpine:3.20` work end-to-end: (1) HasAction 403→challengeAuth(401) in core; (2) Redis JWT cache losing Access claims (JSON serialization fix); (3) MinIO bucket auto-creation in storage Ping(); (4) dev tenant FK seeded in metadata 00002 migration; (5) CreateRepository auto-org-create from `org/repo` name; (6) dev cert SANs added in gen-dev-certs.sh for Go 1.15+ TLS. Also wired SEC-008 mTLS fix (clientCreds() helper in core server.go).
- **ARCHITECTURE.md created (2026-06-10):** Full system architecture document at repo root. Covers all 12 services, ASCII system diagram, docker login/push/pull sequence diagrams, async pipeline flow, custom domain resolution, multi-tenancy model, infrastructure components, and design decisions.
- **SEC-008 resolved (2026-06-10):** `registry-core` gRPC clients now use `libs/auth/mtls.ClientTLSConfig()` when cert paths are configured. Falls back to insecure with `slog.Warn` only in dev without certs. Moved to Resolved in `security.md`.
- **Proxy mTLS fix (2026-06-11):** `registry-proxy` gRPC clients also applied the SEC-008 `clientCreds()` pattern. Proxy was using `insecure.NewCredentials()` — TLS handshake failed silently → all auth calls returned error → all requests 401. Also triggered `go mod tidy` in `services/storage` (transitive redis dep from new `libs/middleware/grpc/cache.go`).
- **Pull-through cache E2E test (2026-06-11):** `GET /v2/cache/dockerhub/library/alpine/manifests/3.20` returns HTTP 200 with full OCI image index (multi-arch manifest list, 9226 bytes). Manifest stored in `proxy_manifests` DB table. Second request served from cache.
- **Proxy AUTH_REALM fix (2026-06-11):** `registry-proxy` `challengeAuth` previously pointed to `https://<host>/v2/token` — a non-existent endpoint on the proxy. Added `AUTH_REALM string` to proxy config (default `http://localhost:8080/auth/token`) and wired it into `HTTPHandler`. `WWW-Authenticate` now points to `registry-auth` exactly like `registry-core`. Docker follows the standard token-auth flow automatically. Tested: `docker login localhost:8084` and `docker pull localhost:8084/cache/dockerhub/library/alpine:3.20` both succeed. Commit `f2eb380`.
- **OCI conformance 75/75 PASS (2026-06-12):** `make test-conformance` in `services/core` passes the full OCI Distribution Spec v1.1 suite: 75 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped (skips are optional spec features not advertised). Key fixes applied across this session: (1) gRPC cold-start 401 — first `ValidateToken` RPC also establishes TCP/TLS/HTTP2 connection; increased timeout 5s→15s + `Connect()` pre-warming at startup; (2) single-segment namespace routing — cross-repo blob mount targets like `conformance-<uuid>` have no `/`; all route thresholds lowered to `n≥3` and `ValidateName` removed from `handleInitiateUpload`; (3) OCI spec §4.4 compliance — `DeleteManifest` now deletes ONLY the tag when reference is a tag name, leaving the manifest accessible by digest; (4) Range header off-by-one in `handleGetUpload` — was returning `0-{offset}`, now correctly returns `0-{offset-1}`; (5) OCI referrer tracking — new `ReferrerStore` (Redis SADD/SMEMBERS keyed by `refs:<tenantID>:<repoName>:<subjectDigest>`), `PutManifest` parses `subject`/`artifactType`/`config.mediaType` (OCI §6.2 fallback) and registers referrers, `handlePutManifest` sets `OCI-Subject` header, `handleReferrers` returns real OCI image index with `?artifactType=` filter support.
