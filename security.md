## Open Issues

> No open security findings as of 2026-06-18 (excluding pentest findings below).
> Backend feature gaps (KMS signing backends, Notary v2, etc.) are tracked in
> `status.md` Sprint 6 — those are unimplemented features rather than
> security regressions, so they live in the project tracker, not here.

## Pentest Findings — 2026-06-18

> Findings from a thorough security review of the system. Each item is logged
> with a reproducible description and a concrete remediation path so they can
> be triaged into a fix sprint. ID prefix `PENTEST-` keeps these separate from
> the original SEC- items (which were author-flagged during development).
>
> **Triage tip:** CRITICAL and HIGH should be fixed before any non-local
> deployment. MEDIUM should be fixed before GA. LOW and INFO can be batched.

### CRITICAL

| ID | Severity | Title | Service | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PENTEST-001 | CRITICAL | Audit HTTP API unauthenticated | `registry-audit` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |

**PENTEST-001 — Audit HTTP API has no authentication** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** `services/audit/internal/server/server.go:100-101` registered `POST /audit/events` and `GET /audit/events` with no auth middleware. Any process that could reach the audit pod's HTTP port (8080 by default) could forge audit log entries for any tenant, read every tenant's audit trail, or DoS the audit pipeline.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Applied remediation option (c) — **removed the HTTP write/query API entirely**. Verified via grep that no caller anywhere in the codebase consumed `POST/GET /audit/events`; the endpoints were dead code. All audit writes already flow through the RabbitMQ `eventconsumer` (durable + DLQ via `audit.events` queue with routing key `#`), and reads flow through the mTLS-gated `AuditService` gRPC API consumed by `registry-management.GetBuildHistory`. The fix:
  1. Removed route registrations from `services/audit/internal/server/server.go`
  2. Deleted `services/audit/internal/handler/http.go` (the unused `HTTPHandler`, `WriteEvent`, `QueryEvents`)
  3. Retained `/healthz` on the HTTP port for liveness probes
  4. Added a comment block in `server.go` documenting that re-introducing an HTTP write/query API requires mTLS + CN allowlist
- **Defense-in-depth result:** Audit log integrity now depends only on (1) mTLS on the gRPC port + (2) FORCE RLS + `registry_audit_app` low-privilege role (SEC-001) + (3) RabbitMQ DLQ for malformed events. No HTTP attack surface.

### HIGH

| ID | Severity | Title | Service | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PENTEST-002 | HIGH | RBAC scope not enforced in management API | `registry-management` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-003 | HIGH | Public user creation with arbitrary tenant_id | `registry-auth` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-004 | HIGH | Username enumeration via login timing attack | `registry-auth` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-005 | HIGH | Username enumeration via lockout/disabled status codes | `registry-auth` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |

**PENTEST-002 — RBAC scope not enforced in management API** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** `getUserRoles` returned a flat list of role names for the entire tenant. All RBAC enforcement sites used `hasRole(roles, "admin")` without scope, so admin-of-org-A could grant/revoke roles in org-B, delete repos in org-B, etc.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Introduced a scope-aware authorization model end-to-end:
  1. **Proto:** added `repeated RoleAssignment role_assignments = 3` to `GetUserPermissionsResponse` so callers receive full per-scope assignment info (not just role names).
  2. **Auth backend:** `services/auth/internal/handler/grpc.go` `GetUserPermissions` now populates the new field with `{role, scope_type, scope_value, id}` for every assignment.
  3. **Management:** added `getUserAssignments(r)` and `hasScopedRole(assignments, scopeType, scopeValue, minRole)` in `services/management/internal/handler/rbac.go`. The helper implements the containment rule: org-scoped grants cover all repos in that org (`"myorg/anything"` matches an org grant on `"myorg"`); repo grants do NOT bubble up to the parent org or sibling repos.
  4. **Updated every enforcement site** to call `hasScopedRole` with the URL's actual scope:
     - `handleCreateRepository` → `("org", body.Org, "admin")`
     - `handleDeleteRepository` → `("repo", "org/repo", "admin")`
     - `handleDeleteTag` → `("repo", "org/repo", "writer")`
     - `handleTriggerScan` → `("repo", "org/repo", "writer")` (was previously unchecked — bonus fix)
     - `handleGrantOrgMember` / `handleRevokeOrgMember` → `("org", org, "admin")`
     - `handleGrantRepoMember` / `handleRevokeRepoMember` → `("repo", "org/repo", "admin")`
  5. **Tests:** `services/management/internal/handler/rbac_test.go` adds 6 dedicated tests including the specific attack scenarios — `orgGrantDoesNotCoverSiblingOrg`, `repoGrantDoesNotCoverSiblingRepo`, and `orgPrefixIsNotSubstring` (a "my" admin must not match "myorg/...").
- **Cross-check:** the auth-side `GrantRole`/`RevokeRole` gRPC handlers still don't authorize the caller (they only insert/delete). This is acceptable because gRPC is mTLS-restricted to internal services that perform authz before calling — but if any new service ever calls these handlers, it must enforce scope-aware authz on its own caller too. Future hardening: add caller authz inside the auth gRPC handlers as defence-in-depth.

**PENTEST-003 — Public user creation with arbitrary tenant_id** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** `POST /api/v1/users` was unauthenticated and accepted any `tenant_id` from the request body. Allowed account squatting, username enumeration via 409 responses, user-table DoS via Argon2 spam, and cross-tenant user injection (attacker logs in as the injected user and gets a JWT carrying the target tenant's UUID).
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Applied remediation option (a) — admin-only endpoint:
  1. `createUser` now calls `requireAuth` first; anonymous requests get `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.
  2. The target tenant is taken from the caller's JWT `tenant_id` claim. If `body.tenant_id` is supplied it must match — otherwise `403 DENIED "cannot create users in a different tenant"`.
  3. The caller must hold an `admin` or `owner` role somewhere in that tenant, verified via a new `callerIsTenantAdmin` helper that calls `svc.GetUserRoles` and fails closed on lookup error. Non-admins get `403 DENIED "admin role required to create users"`.
  4. Bootstrap (first user in a tenant) deliberately CANNOT happen through this endpoint — it must come from a seed migration (`services/auth/migrations/20260610000001_seed_dev_tenant.sql` does this for dev) or out-of-band tooling. This is by design: an unauthenticated bootstrap path would re-introduce the original vulnerability.
- **Tests:** `services/auth/internal/handler/http_test.go` adds three dedicated security tests — `TestCreateUser_noAuth_returns401`, `TestCreateUser_callerNotAdmin_returns403`, `TestCreateUser_crossTenant_returns403` — plus updates the existing happy-path tests to thread an admin token through the new `newAdminAuthedRequest` helper. All 7 createUser tests pass.
- **Follow-up considerations:** A future "platform admin" endpoint for super-admins who manage multiple tenants would need a separate route (e.g. `POST /api/v1/admin/tenants/{id}/users`) gated by a new platform-admin role marker — out of scope for this fix.

**PENTEST-004 — Username enumeration via login timing attack** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** Unknown user → fast path (~5 ms, DB lookup only). Known user, wrong password → slow path (~100 ms, Argon2id verify). The reliable measurable gap let an attacker enumerate valid usernames over the network.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Added `dummyArgonHash()` in `services/auth/internal/service/auth.go` — a lazily-generated (`sync.Once`) Argon2id hash of a throwaway password. In `AuthenticateUser`, when `GetByUsername` returns `ErrNotFound`, we still call `argon2pkg.Verify(password, dummyArgonHash())` and discard the result, so the wall-clock time matches the known-user-wrong-password path.
- **Tests:** `TestAuthenticateUser_unknownUsername_runsDummyVerify` directly measures both paths and fails if the ratio diverges by more than 4× — a deliberately loose threshold (CI flakiness) but tight enough to catch a regression that bypasses the dummy verify (would yield a >10× gap).

**PENTEST-005 — Username enumeration via lockout/disabled status codes** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** `403 "account locked"` and `403 "account disabled"` leaked whether a username existed in the tenant.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Both HTTP handlers (`/auth/token` and `/api/v1/login`) now collapse ALL auth-failure variants — unknown user, wrong password, locked, disabled — to one identical `401 UNAUTHORIZED "invalid credentials"` response. A new `logAuthFailure` helper classifies the underlying cause at `slog.Info`/`slog.Warn` server-side so ops still see lockout events. The typed errors (`ErrAccountLocked`, `ErrAccountDisabled`) remain in the service layer for internal flow control but never propagate to the wire.
- **Tests:** `TestLogin_unknownVsKnown_returnsSameStatusAndBody` asserts that probing an unknown username and a known username with the wrong password produces identical HTTP responses (same status, byte-identical body) — the explicit no-oracle guarantee. The three legacy tests that asserted the old `403 "account locked/disabled"` behavior were inverted to assert `401` (renamed `_returns401_noLeakage`).

### MEDIUM

| ID | Severity | Title | Service | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PENTEST-006 | MEDIUM | Member list endpoints leak roles to non-admin tenant users | `registry-management` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-007 | MEDIUM | Webhook response body not size-limited | `registry-webhook` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-008 | MEDIUM | CORS middleware always returns allowed origin | `registry-management` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-009 | MEDIUM | WWW-Authenticate parser splits on comma naively | `registry-proxy` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-010 | MEDIUM | AUTH_REALM default uses HTTP, not HTTPS | `registry-core`, `registry-proxy` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-011 | MEDIUM | RBAC revoke does not verify assignment belongs to scope | `registry-management` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |

**PENTEST-006 — Member list leaks roles** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** `handleListOrgMembers` and `handleListRepoMembers` had no role check; any authenticated tenant user could enumerate org/repo members.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Both handlers now require at least `reader` on the target scope via `hasScopedRole`. Non-members receive `404 not found` (not `403 forbidden`) so the existence of the org/repo isn't confirmed. Bundled with the PENTEST-002 fix.

**PENTEST-007 — Webhook response body not size-limited** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** `services/webhook/internal/delivery/dispatcher.go` drained the full response body with `io.Copy(io.Discard, resp.Body)` — no upper bound. A hostile webhook endpoint could stream unbounded bytes back, tying up worker goroutines for the full request timeout.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Added `maxResponseBytes = 8 * 1024` constant and wrapped the discard copy with `io.LimitReader(resp.Body, maxResponseBytes)`. Webhook ACKs are typically empty or a few hundred bytes; 8 KB is generous. Same hardening applied opportunistically to the signer Vault key-fetch and sign paths (both now capped at 64 KB) — they previously read unbounded `io.ReadAll` on the error path.

**PENTEST-008 — CORS middleware always returns configured origin** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** The middleware unconditionally echoed a fixed origin and never set `Vary: Origin`, weakening defense-in-depth and blocking any future multi-origin support.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Rewrote `services/management/internal/middleware/cors.go` to:
  - Accept a comma-separated allowlist (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://a.example,https://b.example`) — single-origin configurations still work since they're a one-element list.
  - Always emit `Vary: Origin` so caching proxies key on origin even for blocked responses.
  - Echo `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` only when the request's `Origin` is in the allowlist (exact RFC 6454 match, case-sensitive). Disallowed origins receive no CORS headers and the browser blocks via SOP.
  - Skip CORS headers entirely on non-CORS requests (no `Origin` header) so same-origin responses stay clean.
  - Always return 204 for OPTIONS, regardless of allowlist outcome, so an attacker can't probe the allowlist via preflight differences.
- **Tests:** 5 new tests in `cors_test.go`: allowed-origin echo, disallowed-origin omission (the defining PENTEST-008 test), no-Origin clean response, preflight-always-204, and case-sensitive matching.

**PENTEST-009 — `parseBearerChallenge` splits on `,` naively** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** The parser used `strings.Split(header, ",")` which broke for quoted values containing commas (e.g. `scope="repository:foo,bar:pull"`), causing pull failures against any upstream registry that uses comma-bearing scopes.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Rewrote `parseBearerChallenge` with a quote-aware tokenizer (`splitCommaRespectingQuotes`) that walks the header tracking quote state, plus an `unescapeQuoted` helper that resolves the RFC 7230 backslash escapes (`\"` → `"`, `\\` → `\`) inside quoted strings. Comma-bearing scopes are now preserved as a single value.
- **Tests:** 4 new tests in `parse_challenge_test.go`: simple Docker Hub-style header, the defining quoted-comma case, escaped quotes inside a value, and tolerance of malformed segments (extra whitespace, missing `=`).

**PENTEST-010 — AUTH_REALM defaults to HTTP** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** Both `registry-core` and `registry-proxy` defaulted `AUTH_REALM` to `http://localhost:8080/auth/token`. An operator deploying without overriding it would direct Docker clients to send Basic-auth credentials over plaintext.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Added `validateAuthRealm(realm, environment)` in both `services/core/internal/config/config.go` and `services/proxy/internal/config/config.go`. The validator:
  - **Refuses** `http://` when `OTEL_ENVIRONMENT` is `production` or `staging` — startup fails fast with a clear error.
  - **Warns** at `slog.Warn` when `http://` is used in any other environment (development, empty, etc.) so misconfiguration is visible in logs.
  - **Accepts** `https://` everywhere; rejects other schemes (`ftp://` etc.) outright.
  - Scheme matching is case-insensitive (`HTTPS://` accepted) but the rest of the URL is preserved verbatim.
- **Tests:** 10 table-driven subtests in `auth_realm_test.go` covering every combination of scheme × environment plus malformed-URL / case-folding paths. Both core and proxy share the same validator semantics so the test coverage applies to both.

**PENTEST-011 — Revoke does not verify assignment belongs to scope** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** Both revoke handlers passed the assignment ID to the auth gRPC `RevokeRole` without verifying the assignment's scope matched the URL path. Admin-of-org-A could delete assignments in org-B by URL-guessing or by visibility through `ListMembers`.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Added two new fields to `RevokeRoleRequest` proto — `expected_scope_type` and `expected_scope_value`. Management's revoke handlers populate them from the URL path. Auth's `RevokeRoleScoped` repository method extends the DELETE SQL with `($3 = '' OR scope_type = $3) AND ($4 = '' OR scope_value = $4)` so a mismatched assignment matches zero rows and returns `ErrNotFound`. Auth's gRPC handler maps that to `codes.NotFound` indistinguishable from "row doesn't exist" — preventing scope enumeration via error differences.

### LOW

| ID | Severity | Title | Service | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PENTEST-012 | LOW | TLS minimum version is 1.2 | `libs/auth/mtls` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-013 | LOW | Authorization header parsing is case-sensitive | `registry-management`, `registry-core` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-014 | LOW | No per-tenant read rate limit on management API | `registry-management` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-015 | LOW | Dashboard `useUserIsAdmin` reads from non-existent localStorage entry | `frontend/` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-016 | LOW | Audit HTTP `QueryEvents` allows unbounded `limit` param | `registry-audit` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |

**PENTEST-012 — TLS 1.2 minimum** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** `libs/auth/mtls/mtls.go` set `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12` for both server and client mTLS configs. Internal service-to-service mTLS has no legacy-client constraint and should mandate the modern baseline.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Set `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS13` in both `ServerTLSConfig` and `ClientTLSConfig`. TLS 1.3 mandates forward secrecy and AEAD-only cipher suites, removing legacy renegotiation. No external clients touch these gRPC ports — all calls are service-to-service inside the cluster.

**PENTEST-013 — Authorization header case-sensitive parse** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** Hand-rolled `strings.HasPrefix(authHeader, "Bearer ")` checks rejected `bearer xyz` (lowercase) and other case variants even though RFC 7235 §2.1 makes auth scheme names case-insensitive.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Created `libs/auth/bearer/bearer.go` with `Extract(authHeader)` that case-insensitively matches the `Bearer` scheme and returns the token plus a found-flag. Updated every parsing site (`registry-auth` `requireAuth` + `refreshToken`, `registry-core` `authenticate`, `registry-proxy` `authenticate`, `registry-management` `RequireAuth`) to use the helper. Basic-auth parsing in core/proxy also switched to `strings.EqualFold` for symmetry.
- **Tests:** 12 table-driven cases in `bearer_test.go` covering all-uppercase, all-lowercase, mixed-case, tab separator, scheme-only, empty, Basic-scheme rejection, and the `BearerExt`-confusable rejection.

**PENTEST-014 — No per-tenant read rate limit** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** No per-user cap on `/api/v1/*` reads. An authenticated tenant user could hammer stats/repositories endpoints to drive load on metadata + audit.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Added `PerUserRateLimiter` in `services/management/internal/middleware/ratelimit.go`:
  - In-process token bucket via `golang.org/x/time/rate`, keyed by user_id from `UserIDFromContext`.
  - Default 20 rps with burst 40 — generous for an interactive dashboard, blocks a runaway script.
  - Background GC sweeps stale buckets every 5 minutes (10-minute idle TTL), keeping memory bounded.
  - Returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After: 1` when exceeded.
  - Passes through requests without an authenticated user_id (e.g. `/healthz`) so unauthenticated probes don't poison everyone's bucket.
  - Wired into `Handler.Register` after `RequireAuth` populates context, so the limiter sees the user_id. Optional via `WithRateLimiter` for tests that need deterministic timing.
- **Multi-replica note:** in-process by design; with N replicas the effective cluster cap is N×20 rps. A Redis-backed limiter can drop in transparently if a global cap is needed, by satisfying the same `Middleware` signature.

**PENTEST-015 — `useUserIsAdmin` reads non-existent localStorage entry** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original issue:** `dashboard/index.tsx:22` read `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')` — a key that's never written anywhere (the token lives only in Zustand memory per FE-SEC-001). The hook always returned `false`, so admin UI was permanently hidden.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):**
  1. Added `roles?: string[]` to `AuthUser` in `frontend/src/store/authStore.ts` so the existing `JSON.parse(atob(...)) as AuthUser` decode path picks up the JWT `roles` claim end-to-end (backend already emits it per the PENTEST-002 / roles-claim work).
  2. Rewrote `useUserIsAdmin` in `frontend/src/routes/_authenticated/dashboard/index.tsx` to read `roles` from `useAuthStore` and check `includes('admin') || includes('owner')`.
- **Verified:** frontend `tsc --noEmit` clean. End-to-end chain: backend `Login` → JWT roles claim → Zustand store → admin UI gate.

**PENTEST-016 — Audit `limit` param** — RESOLVED ✅ (by removal)
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** The entire audit HTTP API (`POST/GET /audit/events`) was removed in the PENTEST-001 fix. The `limit` query parameter no longer exists. The audit query path is now gRPC-only (`AuditService.GetBuildHistory`), which enforces its own server-side cap.

### INFORMATIONAL

| ID | Severity | Title | Service | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PENTEST-017 | INFO | Default dev credentials in docker-compose | `infra/` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-018 | INFO | `sslmode=prefer` in dev compose | `infra/` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-019 | INFO | Scanner plugin cache directory writable by non-root | `registry-scanner` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) |
| PENTEST-020 | INFO | No CSRF protection on state-changing management endpoints | `registry-management` | RESOLVED ✅ (2026-06-18) (accepted-with-conditions, code-level guard added) |

**PENTEST-017 — Default dev credentials** — RESOLVED ✅
- **Original risk:** A docker-compose deployment promoted to a non-local environment without overriding `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS`, `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, or `VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN` would silently ship with publicly-known credentials.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Added `CheckDevDefaults` and `CheckDevDefaultsFromDSN` to `libs/config/loader/dev_defaults.go`. A central `wellKnownDevDefaults` map enumerates every default credential shipped in compose. Behaviour:
  - **`OTEL_ENVIRONMENT=production` or `staging`:** any match returns a startup error that names the offending env var. The process refuses to start.
  - **Any other environment (development, empty):** matches log at `slog.Warn` so the operator sees them at boot.
- **Wiring:** `DBConfig.PoolConfig()` now calls `CheckDevDefaultsFromDSN` automatically, so every service that uses the shared pool helper (auth, metadata, audit, tenant, webhook, proxy) gets the check for free. Storage (`STORAGE_MINIO_SECRET_KEY`) and signer (`VAULT_TOKEN`) call `CheckDevDefaults` explicitly in their `validate` functions. The three services that build temp `DBConfig` structs (audit, webhook, tenant) now pass `Environment: cfg.OTELEnvironment` so the check engages there too.
- **Tests:** 14 cases in `dev_defaults_test.go` cover production-rejection, staging-rejection, dev-warning, strong-credential acceptance, unknown-env tolerance, unknown-credential-name passthrough, and DSN password extraction for both postgres-URL and amqp-URL formats.

**PENTEST-018 — `sslmode=prefer` in dev compose** — RESOLVED ✅ (already mitigated)
- **Original risk:** Dev compose uses `sslmode=prefer` which silently falls back to plaintext if the server lacks a cert.
- **Resolution:** Three layered mitigations cover this:
  1. **SEC-022:** `loader.PoolConfig()` rejects `sslmode=disable` outright at startup.
  2. **SEC-022 continued:** Any sslmode weaker than `require` emits a `slog.Warn` at boot listing the offending DSN parameter.
  3. **PENTEST-017 (above):** in `OTEL_ENVIRONMENT=production`, the dev-default password (which is what gets transmitted in cleartext under `prefer`) also refuses to start. So even if `prefer` survives into production, the password check blocks first.
- The `prefer` mode remains supported in dev because the embedded postgres compose service runs without TLS — switching it to `require` would break local-dev startup.

**PENTEST-019 — Scanner plugin cache writable** — RESOLVED ✅ (documented + alternative hardening path)
- **Original risk:** `/trivy-cache` is writable by the scanner process. A subverted Trivy binary could write malicious DB files into the cache.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):** Codified the trust model in `services/scanner/Dockerfile` with an inline comment that lists all three in-place mitigations (binary SHA256 verification via `SCANNER_PLUGIN_CHECKSUM`, non-root execution as UID 65532, read-only container FS outside cache + tmp) plus the recommended hardening path for operators who need stricter cache integrity (tmpfs-backed overlay, or pre-baked read-only DB layers with `TRIVY_NO_PROGRESS`). The `infra/runbooks/scanner-cache-hardening.md` runbook reference is the deployment-time follow-up.
- The risk is bounded: an attacker who can swap the Trivy binary already controls the scanner process, so cache-tampering doesn't expand impact beyond what plugin-binary tampering already provides — and that path is checksum-blocked.

**PENTEST-020 — No CSRF protection on management API** — RESOLVED ✅ (accepted-with-conditions, code-level guard)
- **Original posture:** No CSRF tokens, but JWT in `Authorization` header (not cookies) + strict CORS allowlist makes CSRF impossible by construction.
- **Resolution (2026-06-18):**
  1. Documented the load-bearing assumption in `services/management/internal/middleware/auth.go` with a multi-line comment on `RequireAuth` explaining why the current architecture is CSRF-immune and exactly what would need to change if cookie-based auth is ever added.
  2. Added an `assertNoCookieAuth` package-level marker string that doubles as a search target for future code reviewers: anyone searching for `r.Cookie(` in this file should get zero hits. Any future patch that adds cookie auth would have to also delete this marker, which a reviewer would notice.
- **Re-open trigger:** when FE-SEC-009 (refresh tokens via `HttpOnly` cookie) is implemented, this finding must reopen with CSRF tokens (double-submit cookie pattern or per-session token in header) added alongside.

## Resolved Issues

| ID | Title | Service | Resolved | How |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | Audit table RLS bypassed by schema owner role | `registry-audit` | 2026-06-10 | Migration `20240101000002_audit_rls_role.sql` creates `registry_audit_app` NOLOGIN role, grants INSERT+SELECT on `audit_events` and DELETE on `audit_events_default` (retention path). `ALTER TABLE audit_events FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` applies RLS even to the table owner. INSERT and SELECT policies defined; no UPDATE/DELETE policy → default-deny. Pool `AfterConnect` does `SET ROLE registry_audit_app` on every connection. `checkRole()` in `server.go` fails startup if effective role is not `registry_audit_app`. |
| SEC-002 | GC advisory locks: undefined locking behaviour under concurrent workers | `registry-gc` | 2026-06-11 | `services/gc/internal/advisory/lock.go` — `pg_try_advisory_lock(int8)` with FNV-64a key from tenant UUID. Connection pinned via `pgxpool.Acquire()`; explicit `pg_advisory_unlock` + `Release()` in deferred unlock. `runForTenant()` helper scopes the lock to one tenant at a time. `GC_ADVISORY_LOCK_DB_DSN` env var; no-op when unset (single-worker safe). |
| SEC-003 | Go plugin scanner path: supply chain and ABI risk | `registry-scanner` | 2026-06-11 | `.so` path was never implemented. `process.go` now uses pipe + `io.LimitReader(stdoutPipe, 10<<20)` instead of `cmd.Output()`. `pluginEnv()` passes an explicit allowlist (PATH, HOME, TMPDIR, TRIVY_*/GRYPE_* prefixes only) — all other env vars including DB/JWT credentials are stripped. |
| SEC-033 | `IsPasswordPolicyError` uses fragile string-prefix heuristic | `registry-auth` | 2026-06-12 | Defined `PasswordPolicyError` sentinel struct in `service/password.go`; `ValidatePassword` now returns `&PasswordPolicyError{...}`. `IsPasswordPolicyError` rewritten to use `errors.As(err, new(*PasswordPolicyError))` — type-safe, handles wrapped chains, no string matching. |
| SEC-004 | Proxy background store: fire-and-forget failure creates silent inconsistency | `registry-proxy` | 2026-06-11 | Background goroutine calls `publishStoreQueued()` on failure, which publishes a `store.queued` RabbitMQ event. `HandleStoreQueued` consumer re-fetches blob from upstream and retries the store. Dead-letters after 3 retries via `consumer.Config{MaxRetries: 3}`. No-op when `RABBITMQ_URL` is unset. |
| SEC-008 | gRPC clients use plaintext transport | `registry-core`, `registry-proxy` | 2026-06-10 / 2026-06-11 | Added `clientCreds()` helper in both `services/core/internal/server/server.go` and `services/proxy/internal/server/server.go`. Calls `libs/auth/mtls.ClientTLSConfig()` when cert paths are set; falls back to insecure with `slog.Warn` in dev. Proxy was the root cause of all-401s on pull-through cache — insecure gRPC to mTLS-enabled auth service silently failed TLS handshake. |
| SEC-014 | New services gRPC servers had no interceptors or mTLS | `registry-signer`, `registry-gc`, `registry-tenant`, `registry-webhook`, `registry-audit` | 2026-06-10 | Applied `buildGRPCOptions()` pattern (from `registry-auth`) to all five services. Each now has recovery interceptor, OTEL tracing, structured logging, and optional mTLS when cert paths are configured. Commit `c4e08d7`. |
| SEC-005 | JWT revocation TTL coupling undocumented | `registry-auth` | 2026-06-12 | `RevokeToken` now derives Redis TTL from `time.Until(claims.ExpiresAt.Time)` with a comment explaining the self-cleaning coupling. `ValidateToken` comment cross-references the contract. |
| SEC-006 | Connection pool exhaustion not mapped to ResourceExhausted | All PostgreSQL-using services | 2026-06-17 | `libs/errors/codes.MapDBError` now detects `context.DeadlineExceeded` and `pgxpool` exhaustion paths and maps to `codes.ResourceExhausted`. `libs/config/loader.DBConfig.PoolConfig()` sets `ConnectTimeout: 5s`, `MaxConnLifetime: 30m`, `MaxConnIdleTime: 5m` so stale connections cannot accumulate. gRPC client retry interceptor was updated to skip `ResourceExhausted`. Commit `0f95144`. |
| SEC-007 | Missing HTTP security response headers | `registry-auth`, `registry-core` | 2026-06-12 | Created `libs/middleware/http/secure_headers.go` with `SecureHeaders` middleware setting `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-XSS-Protection: 0`. Applied to auth and core HTTP servers. |
| SEC-009 | IP rate limiting targets gateway IP, not client IP | `registry-auth` | 2026-06-12 | `remoteIP()` now checks `X-Forwarded-For` only when TCP peer is in `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` (comma-separated env var). Falls back to `RemoteAddr` for direct connections. Startup warning when CIDR list is empty. |
| SEC-010 | registry-core gRPC server has no interceptors or mTLS | `registry-core` | 2026-06-12 | Added `buildGRPCOptions()` to `services/core/internal/server/server.go` — same pattern as auth/storage/metadata (recovery + OTEL + logging + optional mTLS). |
| SEC-011 | createUser leaks internal error strings | `registry-auth` | 2026-06-12 | Added `service.IsPasswordPolicyError(err)` helper. Policy errors (safe) get 400 with message; argon2 failures get 500 with generic message and are logged via `slog.ErrorContext`. |
| SEC-012 | Proxy blob handler stores partial blob on client disconnect | `registry-proxy` | 2026-06-12 | `handleGetBlob` now calls `pw.CloseWithError(copyErr)` on client disconnect so the background goroutine receives a non-EOF error and aborts without calling `CloseAndRecv`. |
| SEC-013 | Proxy blob requests missing digest format validation | `registry-proxy` | 2026-06-12 | Added `digestRE = regexp.MustCompile("^sha256:[a-f0-9]{64}$")` to proxy handler. Guards at top of `handleGetBlob` and `handleHeadBlob` return `DIGEST_INVALID` (400) on mismatch. |
| SEC-015 | `registry-signer` in-memory sigstore was volatile | `registry-signer` | 2026-06-17 | Replaced the `sync.RWMutex`-protected map with PostgreSQL persistence. `services/signer/migrations/` adds a `signatures` table; `internal/sigstore/store.go` writes through to the DB and keeps an in-process LRU cache. `SigB64` is not persisted in cleartext — only the signature digest plus the verifiable Cosign payload reference. `VerifyManifest` now returns the correct result across restarts and across multiple signer replicas. Commit `0f95144`. |
| SEC-016 | Tenant domain name not validated in RegisterDomain | `registry-tenant` | 2026-06-12 | Added RFC 1123 `domainRE` and IP-address rejection to both `RegisterDomain` and `ResolveDomain`. Returns `codes.InvalidArgument` for non-conforming domains. |
| SEC-017 | Tenant name not validated against allowlist | `registry-tenant` | 2026-06-12 | Added `tenantNameRE` (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{1,63}$`) to `CreateTenant`. pgx `23505` unique violation mapped to `codes.AlreadyExists` via `isDuplicateKeyError` helper. |
| SEC-018 | Audit HTTP endpoints missing body size limit | `registry-audit` | 2026-06-12 | `WriteEvent` wraps `r.Body` with `http.MaxBytesReader(w, r.Body, 1<<20)` before JSON decode as defence-in-depth alongside the server-level `MaxBytesHandler`. |
| SEC-019 | HTTP servers missing ReadHeaderTimeout | All services | 2026-06-12 | Added `ReadHeaderTimeout: 10 * time.Second` to all 12 service HTTP servers that were missing it. |
| SEC-020 | HTTP servers missing ReadTimeout and WriteTimeout | All services | 2026-06-12 | Added `ReadTimeout: 30 * time.Second` and `WriteTimeout: 30 * time.Second` (60s for blob-streaming services) to all 12 service HTTP servers. |
| SEC-021 | Healthcheck binary uses http.DefaultClient without timeout | `libs/cmd/healthcheck` | 2026-06-12 | Replaced `http.Get(addr)` with `&http.Client{Timeout: 5*time.Second}`. Removed `//nolint:gosec` suppression. |
| SEC-022 | sslmode=prefer in docker-compose contradicts sslmode=require | All DB services | 2026-06-12 | `libs/config/loader/loader.go` now emits `slog.Warn` when DSN `sslmode` is not `"require"`. Dev compose continues to boot; warning makes the risk visible at startup. |
| SEC-023 | Vault dev root token hardcoded in docker-compose | `vault` (dev) | 2026-06-12 | Vault service and vault-init now use `${VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN:-dev-root-token}`. Warning comment added above the vault block. `VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN=` added to `.env.example`. |
| SEC-024 | Dev TLS private keys made world-readable | `cert-init` | 2026-06-12 | `scripts/gen-dev-certs.sh` now uses `chmod 644 *.crt` + `chown 65532:65532 *.key; chmod 600 *.key` instead of `chmod a+r *.key`. |
| SEC-025 | `/metrics` endpoints exposed on the public HTTP port | All services | 2026-06-17 | Every service now spins up a dedicated metrics HTTP server on `cfg.MetricsAddr` (default `:9090`) separate from the business port. NetworkPolicy stencils in `infra/helm/` allow only the Prometheus pod to reach the metrics port. Verified in `services/auth/internal/server/server.go`, `services/audit/.../server.go`, `services/core/.../server.go` plus all other services. Commit `0f95144`. |
| SEC-026 | OTEL exporter uses hardcoded insecure gRPC | All services | 2026-06-12 | Added `otelInsecure()` helper reading `OTEL_INSECURE` env var. `WithInsecure()` now only applied when `OTEL_INSECURE=true`. `docker-compose.yml` sets `OTEL_INSECURE: "true"` for local dev. |
| SEC-027 | Default weak passwords in docker-compose not warned against | `postgres`, `rabbitmq`, `minio` | 2026-06-12 | Added `# WARNING:` comments above all three default-password lines in `docker-compose.yml`. |
| SEC-028 | context.Background() in request handlers | `registry-core`, `registry-auth`, `registry-proxy` | 2026-06-12 | `PutManifest` in core now uses request ctx. Fire-and-forget goroutines (LastUsed update in auth, cache store in proxy, cleanup in core) use `context.Background()` with bounded timeouts and comments explaining the intentional detachment. |
| SEC-029 | Scanner plugin path not sanitised with filepath.Clean | `registry-scanner` | 2026-06-12 | `New()` in `process.go` applies `filepath.Clean` then `filepath.IsAbs` check; fails fast with clear error if path is relative or contains `..` segments. |
| SEC-030 | SecureHeaders middleware never wired into any HTTP server | All services | 2026-06-12 | Added `httpmiddleware "github.com/steveokay/oci-janus/libs/middleware/http"` import and wrapped `http.Server.Handler` with `httpmiddleware.SecureHeaders(...)` as outermost layer in all 12 service `server.go` files. X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection now sent on every HTTP response including error responses from MaxBytesHandler. |
| SEC-031 | tenant/webhook/audit bypass sslmode validation on DB pool | `registry-tenant`, `registry-webhook`, `registry-audit` | 2026-06-12 | Replaced direct `pgxpool.ParseConfig(cfg.DBDSN)` calls with `loader.DBConfig{DBDSN: cfg.DBDSN, DBMaxConns: cfg.DBMaxConns}.PoolConfig()` in all three service Run() functions. sslmode=disable now rejected at startup; weaker modes logged as warning. audit AfterConnect (SET ROLE) preserved after the new PoolConfig call. |
| SEC-032 | fmt.Printf for warnings in core service loses structured context | `registry-core` | 2026-06-12 | Replaced two `fmt.Printf` calls in `registry.go` with `slog.WarnContext` — referrer store failure uses `ctx5`, push.completed publish failure uses `ctx`. Added `"log/slog"` to imports. Warnings now carry trace_id/span_id and appear in the structured log pipeline. |
| SEC-034 | TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS parse errors silently discarded | `registry-auth` | 2026-06-12 | `init()` in `http.go` now calls `slog.Warn` with the offending CIDR entry and parse error when `net.ParseCIDR` fails, so operators see misconfigured entries at startup rather than silently operating with reduced proxy trust coverage. |
| SEC-035 | No server-side RBAC enforcement on OCI push/pull | `registry-core` | 2026-06-14 | `checkAccess()` added to `services/core/internal/handler/http.go`. Calls `GetUserPermissions` on `registry-auth` (5s deadline, fails closed). Enforced on every write handler (`"push"` action: InitiateUpload, PutManifest, DeleteManifest, DeleteBlob) and every read handler (`"pull"` action: GetManifest, HeadManifest, GetBlob, HeadBlob, ListTags). Returns HTTP 403 OCI DENIED on miss or RPC error. Wildcard `*` entries in permission list supported for org-level grants. |
| SEC-036 | RBAC membership changes not audit-logged | `registry-auth` | 2026-06-14 | `GrantRole` and `RevokeRole` gRPC handlers publish `rbac.role_granted` / `rbac.role_revoked` RabbitMQ events after successful DB writes. `registry-audit` consumers record these as audit events. Publish failure is logged but does not roll back the grant/revoke — audit gap is acceptable vs. transaction complexity. `RABBITMQ_URL` is optional in auth config; events are silently skipped when unset (dev environments without a broker). |
