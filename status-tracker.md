# status-tracker.md — Open Remediation + Hardening Work

> **What this file is for:** the curated set of currently-open
> remediation (`REM-NNN`) and security (`SEC-NNN` / `PENTEST-NNN`)
> items, plus partial / blocked surfaces. **Lean by design.**
>
> **Workflow:**
> 1. New item surfaces → add a short entry here (rationale, scope, link to branch / PR when in flight).
> 2. Work happens on a feature branch as usual.
> 3. When the work is **complete** (merged + verified): **remove the entry from this file** and **append a resolution note to [`status.md`](status.md)** (the completed-work log). One entry per item; PR / commit hash / date.
> 4. This file stays short. [`status.md`](status.md) accumulates the audit trail.
>
> **Forward-looking backlog:** see [`futures.md`](futures.md) for
> prioritised work that hasn't started yet (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 items
> without active branches).
>
> **Security disclosures:** see [`security.md`](security.md) — the
> full per-CVE lifecycle (`SEC-*` IDs + resolution dates). Only
> currently-open security items are duplicated here.

## Open remediation items

### REM-013 — Retention surface backend gaps

**Affects:** `services/metadata` (proto + repo + handler), `services/management` (BFF).
**Status:** OPEN — frontend (S11 slices 3 + 4) is partially shipped. Three FE surfaces are blocked by missing backend.

| Gap | What's missing | Blocks FE |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `manifests.retention_pending_delete_at` is exposed via `GetManifest` but not via the `ListTags` projection, so the Tags tab can't render pending-delete pills without a per-row GET fan-out. Needs a column added to the Tag proto (or a parallel `list_tags_with_retention` RPC). | "Pending delete in 24h" pills on the Tags tab |
| 2 | No `retention_runs` table — every retention evaluation is fire-and-forget today. A run-history table would let the dashboard show "we considered X tags, kept Y, graced Z, hard-deleted W per rule". | Per-repo Retention "Run history" panel |
| 3 | Dashboard storage breakdown doesn't expose the bytes-reclaimed-via-retention column. Needs a `GetTenantRetentionSavings(tenant_id)` aggregation RPC + UI plumbing. | Dashboard storage-breakdown "Retention" column |

**Recommended order:** Gap 1 (smallest) → Gap 2 → Gap 3. Each unblocks one FE surface independently.

### REM-016 — `libs/errors/codes.MapDBError` doesn't recognise PostgreSQL error codes

**Surfaced:** 2026-06-23 (PR #32 custom-domain triage).
**Affects:** every service that catches a Postgres error and routes it through `errcodes.MapDBError` (i.e. all of them).
**Status:** OPEN. Tracker filed in PR #33.

**Why this matters:** `MapDBError` only special-cases `context.DeadlineExceeded` → `ResourceExhausted`. Everything else collapses to `codes.Internal` with the caller's fallback message. PgErr 23503 (foreign-key violation), 23505 (unique violation), 23514 (check constraint) all surface as generic 500s. Hides the actionable underlying error.

**Proposed fix:**

| PgErr code | Mapped gRPC code | Body hint |
|---|---|---|
| `23503` foreign_key_violation | `codes.NotFound` | Use `pgErr.ConstraintName` to point at the missing parent row |
| `23505` unique_violation | `codes.AlreadyExists` | e.g. "domain already registered for this tenant" |
| `23514` check_violation | `codes.InvalidArgument` | Catches `format CHECK (format IN (…))` etc. |
| everything else | `codes.Internal` (unchanged) | Same fallback contract |

**Estimated:** ~1-2h including unit tests + verification across services. No API change.

## Open security items

The full audit log lives in [`security.md`](security.md). Only items that remain OPEN are tracked here for ongoing attention.

| ID | Severity | Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PENTEST-030** | LOW | Per-endpoint test-dispatch throttle missing on webhook `Test` action | OPEN | `handleTestWebhook` (`services/management/internal/handler/webhooks.go:348`) only checks `requireWebhookAdmin` then forwards. No per `(tenant_id, endpoint_id)` Redis bucket or daily budget. Per-user 20 rps still amplifies. Tracked for a global rate-limit pass. |
| **PENTEST-033** | LOW | Postman dev passwords still inlined | PARTIAL | Login uses `{{password}}` (`type: secret`) — done. Still open: (a) `NewUser1234!` baked into `createUser` request body at `registry-management.postman_collection.json:114`; (b) dev tenant UUID `98dbe36b-…` defaulted in the env file. Cosmetic cleanup. |

## Partial / blocked surfaces

### S11 Retention slices 3 + 4 (PARTIAL)

- **Slice 3** (FE-API-040): "Run now" trigger + 5s status polling on the Retention tab. **PARTIAL** — pending-delete pills on Tags tab + per-repo Run history panel deferred (blocked by REM-013 gaps 1 + 2).
- **Slice 4** (FE-API-039): org-default Retention surface on new `/orgs/$org/settings` route + cross-link from inherited per-repo policies. **PARTIAL** — dashboard storage-breakdown "Retention" column deferred (blocked by REM-013 gap 3).

The FE work for both slices is wired; only the backend gaps in REM-013 prevent the surfaces from rendering useful data.

## How to use this file

- **One bullet per open item.** Lean by design — if this file passes ~10 sections something is wrong with the workflow.
- **When work ships:**
  1. Remove the entry from this file.
  2. Append a resolution note to [`status.md`](status.md) (one entry per item, with PR / commit hash / date).
- **New surfacings** get an entry here first; once the work is in flight, link the branch / PR; once it ships, move to `status.md`.
- **`futures.md`** is the natural place for things that haven't started yet — not yet picked up, not yet on a branch. This tracker is for things that are *open work*, not *future ideas*.
